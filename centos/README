1. SUMMARY

YABS - is Yet Another Build Script. It provides a simple way to
support your own Centos RPM package repository.

What Yabs it is:
- it can generate binary RPM packages and store them to consistent
  RPM repository;
- it can start your repo from scratch without extra configuration.

What Yabs is not:
- it not provides any UI;
- it can not generate packages for platforms other than host system;
- it can not do simultaneous builds - all builds are make in
  one process;
- all privileges separation must be done on OS level - there is
  no things like 'Yabs users' or 'Yabs groups'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION

Chdir to Yabs sources dir and type:

$ sudo make install

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. UNINSTALLATION

Chdir to Yabs sources dir and type:

$ sudo make uninstall

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. USAGE

After installation passed, Yabs will look for new source RPM packages
in his 'incoming' directory, which locates at /var/lib/yabs/incoming.
When Yabs finds one, it begins build process in chrooted environment.
If build success, it will move binary packages generated to publish
directory (/var/www/html/yabs by default). It will automatically create
(or update, if such exists already) RPM repository based on already
generated packages.
If build fails, Yabs will move failed source RPM to special directory -
/var/lib/yabs/fail/. Any way, you can find build logs in directory
/var/lib/yabs/logs/.

If you already have Apache installed, you can point your zyppers
to http://$HOSTNAME/yabs to use all packages generated.
