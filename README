1. SUMMARY

YABS - is Yet Another Build Script. It provides a simple way to
support your own OpenSUSE RPM package repository.

What Yabs it is:
- it can generate binary RPM packages and store them to consistent
  RPM repository;
- it can start your repo from scratch without extra configuration.

What Yabs it is not:
- it not provides any UI;
- it can not generate packages for platforms other than host system;
- it can not do simultaneous builds - all builds are make in
  one process;
- all privileges separation must be done on OS level - there is
  no things like 'Yabs users' or 'Yabs groups'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION

Chdir to Yabs sources dir and type:

$ sudo make install

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. UNINSTALLATION

Chdir to Yabs sources dir and type:

$ sudo make uninstall

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. USAGE

After installation passed, Yabs will look for new source RPM packages
in him 'incoming' directory, which locates at /var/lib/yabs/incoming.
When Yabs finds one, it begins build process in chrooted environment.
If build success, it will move binary packages generated to publish
directory (/srv/www/htdocs/RPMS by default), and source RPM to
/srv/www/htdocs/SRPMS directory. It will automatically creates
(or updates, if such exists already) RPM repository based on packages
generated.
If build fails, Yabs will move failed source RPM to special directory -
/var/lib/yabs/fail/. Any way, you can find build logs in directory
/var/lib/yabs/logs/.

If you already have Apache installed, you can point your zyppers
to http://$HOSTNAME/RPMS to use all packages generated.
